    "<h1>The Battle of Neighborhoods | Business Proposal | Introduction</h1>\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same r regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project aim to create an analysis of features for new restaurant to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Problem Which Tried to Solve:</h2>\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood to open the new restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Foursquare API:</h2>\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Work Flow:</h2>\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Clustering Approach:</h2>\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:</h2>\n",
    "Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n",
